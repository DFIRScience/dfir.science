iPhone forensic analysis can be complicated, but sometimes you need to quickly access some of the most common information. iOS Logs, Events, And Plists Parser (iLEAPP) is a fast iPhone forensic triage tool that will parse out some of the most common data sources and applications. It is free to use and easy to expand with your own modules written in Python.

This video shows how to get started with iLEAPP if you already have a dump of iPhone data. iLEAPP is a simple way to start with iPhone forensics, but keep in mind that it is not as comprehensive as other tools. You may need to manually conduct an iPhone forensic analysis to pull out more information that iLEAPP cannot yet parse.

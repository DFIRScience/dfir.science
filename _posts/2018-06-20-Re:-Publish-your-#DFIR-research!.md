This is a reply or further discussion to @Brett_Shavers post [Publish your #DFIR Research](https://www.dfir.training/dfir-training-categories-k2/item/143-following-up-on-twitter-conversations-about-publishing-dfir-research).

The main idea is that the dfir community needs a better way to manage its research outputs.
Academic publishing normally takes a few months if it's quick, and a year or longer
if it's not. Add additional research and development time, and a single paper may
be worked on for two to three *years*. Of course, in DFIR we have information that is
needed now (current OS traces), that may no longer be relevant in a year or two.

Brett believes blogging is "the most effective method to disseminate DFIR methods processes, and discoveries."

## Academically speaking
Of course, the academic model *is* too slow and is often stuck behind paywalls. That's why
many areas of study are pre-publishing. There is a lot to talk about here, but the
main keyword is [open science](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=open+science). Basically,
making scientific results open and accessible. This is a huge, controversial area
because it requires very powerful publishing groups to completely change their business model.
**It also requires universities to change the way they assess academic contributions.**

### Two cases of open publishing
Brett talks about a practical paper he wrote and self published.

I would add that some DFIR ideas are unlikely to be published in a DFIR journal.
For example, I wrote an argument piece on [automation in DFIR](https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.4498),
and journals I submitted to found it "out of scope". I published on arXiv as an experiment, and it gets
comparatively good citation rates.

## Brett's suggestion
For work published in blogs, forums, chat rooms and courses:
1. Allow these works to also be published by any and all means that gets the information out (academic publications?)
2. Academia and high-tech associates peer review these non-traditional channels
3. A central long-term repository for this information

## A realization
I started this post thinking about the problems that would stop data sharing, but as I got to this
part of the post I think the academic community already solved a lot of these issues. Specifically,
with something like Open Journal Systems. They allow for private or public reviews of material, 
open access and long term archiving / failover systems.

For practical posts we could just slightly change the review process. As a result, I'm trying to set
up OJS as a test run to see the level of interest. More to come.

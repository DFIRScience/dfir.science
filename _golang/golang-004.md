In this video, we talk about how to do repetitive processes (loops) in Go. Looping is useful when you want to do some action many times. We can use variables in loops to slightly change the parameters of the action each time the program loops. This video covers "for loops" in Golang using two loop creation methods. We also introduce the concept of a "comment" to add human-readable text inside your code. We build on from video 003 and use variables in our loops.

From <a href="http://forensicfocus.com/">ForensicFocus.com</a>:<br /><blockquote>In our next webinar, Jacky Fox, student at UCD School of Computer Science and Informatics, presents the results of her dissertation on Windows Registry reporting - focusing on automating correlation and interpretation. After the webinar Jacky will be available in the Forensic Focus webinars forum to answer any questions.&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>Date: Thursday, November 1st 2012<br />Time: 12PM (midday) EDT US / 4PM GMT UK / 5PM CET Europe<br />Duration: 20 mins&nbsp;</blockquote><blockquote>There is no need to register for this webinar, simply visit <a href="http://www.forensicfocus.com/webinars"><span class="s1">http://www.forensicfocus.com/webinars</span></a> at the above time (the webinar has been pre-recorded and will be archived for viewing later if you are unable to attend).</blockquote>I've worked with Jacky, and know her thesis well.

Questions from students

OK: Now that you have that basic procedure, to your questions.
* "Evidence" is a very specific word. Evidence is something that *supports a claim* in an investigation. Your phone, for example, is not evidence. If we have a claim "you called your friend today," then the [call log] on your phone is the evidence. Remember, all investigation starts with a question. Evidence is related to the question.
* Some labs don't have enough storage space for many computers. Imagine the police station is working on 200 cases, and each of them have 10 computers each! You would need a lot of room to store everything. Instead, police usually try to take only the devices they absolutely need. For everything else, they can make copies of the computers, and take the copies with them. To make copies of the computers, you have to bring forensic toolkits with you on-scene. You have to stay longer at the scene, but you don't have to bring many physical computers with you back to the lab.

Gearing up for the official Alpha 2 release of REAPER Preview here is the change log and feature list:<br /><br /><strong>Back-end:</strong><br /><ul><li>REAPER Preview no longer loop-mounts suspect drives. All data is parsed directly from the raw disk. This not only faster, but we also do not need to worry about the issues talked about <a href="https://DFIR.Science/2010/01/re-read-only-loopback-to-physical-disk.html">here</a>.</li><li>Suspect disks are still set to read-only at the block level</li><li>Back-end is structured in a much more modular way. Programmers could easily insert a certain tool into the work-flow, if necessary</li><li>Preset automatic keyword searching</li><li>Preset automatic hashdb searching</li></ul><strong>Front-End:</strong><br /><ul><li>Whole code re-write. Front-end is now completely modular. Add or remove items with a simple include</li><li>Triage profiles supported! Will explain the concept of triage profiles in the next single</li><li>Greatly-improved Image/video gallery from <a href="http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/php-photoalbum.htm">Dynamic Drive</a> implemented. The automatic image gallery I wrote was not powerful enough, and theirs is very nice. (Video previews are currently not working since the back-end switch).</li><li>Manual file-name and full disk keyword searching now available</li><li>Improved session logging (non-persistent)</li></ul>

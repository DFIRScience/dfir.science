Installation of <a href="http://fives.kau.se/">FIVES</a> Porndetect was relatively painless on Debian Squeeze (Lenny is a bit of a pain).<br />First get the F_PORNDETECT.doc from the FIVES portal. Their documentation is pretty good. I am just adding extras that I come across while installing.<br /><br />Requires:<br /><a href="http://code.google.com/p/iulib/">iulib</a> - Follow gsbabil's single <a href="http://code.google.com/p/iulib/issues/detail?id=18">here</a> for all the deps. If you are in Squeeze autoconf is newer that specified, you will have to run aclocal before ./build.<br />The genAM.py patch was required for both Lenny and Squeeze. Download it into the same dir, and apply it with 'patch -p0 &lt; genAM.py.patch'<br />After that iulib should build/install - you then just need to copy  vidio/vidio.h and imglib/iulib.h to /usr/local/include/<br /><br />I am building from the FIVES 'everything.tar.gz' - so extract it and go into the porndetect dir<br />All the packages in the document (.doc) seemed to work for me except 'imagemagick++9-dev' which was 'libmagick++-dev' in INSTALL.txt.<br /><br />After that you should just be able to 'make' in porndetect, and it works - you will have three executables in the 'build' directory. The command line --help for them is lacking, but the documentation on the FIVES portal makes up for it (and no manual).<br /><br /><strong>I will talk about usage in another single, but now on to building video:</strong><br /><br />For video, it has a lot of the same deps. We just need some video processing libs - see the README in the porndetect-video - it lists all the packages needed. All packages were available from the squeeze repository with no issues (not so with lenny).<br />I was able to build with no issues, and after had to executables in build: porndetect-video and vis-scores.<br /><br />Both of the following require a global.makeinfo file that does not come in the everything package. I am waiting to hear from the group about compiling the modules standalone. Check back later.<br /><br />F_SSEMATCH requires:<br /><a href="http://afflib.org/">afflib</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/libewf/">libewf2</a><br />Both installed from source with no problems based on the packages previously installed.<br /><br />F_FDAE module, standalone. This module is for face and age detection.<br />First we need OpenCV which is available on Squeeze as libcv-dev, and also libsvm-dev which is for machine learning.

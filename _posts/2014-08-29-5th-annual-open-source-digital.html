The 5th Annual <b>Open Source Digital Forensics Conference (OSDFCon)</b> will be held on <b>November 5, 2014</b> at the Westin Washington Dulles in <b>Herndon, VA</b>.  This conference focuses on tools and techniques that are open source and (typically) free to use.  It is a one day event with short talks packed with information.  There are both tool developers and users in attendance, and this is a unique opportunity to learn about new tools and provide feedback. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.basistech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/OSDFcon-2014-logo-WEB-FINAL.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://www.basistech.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/OSDFcon-2014-logo-WEB-FINAL.png" height="160" width="640" /></a>As an investigator, you should attend to learn about new tools and meet the developers building the software.

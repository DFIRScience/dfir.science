The term cybercrime is sometimes used in different ways. This article will look examine the term cybercrime, and give an overview of 'cybercrime technologies' are.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DRbiBT1BBjw/UBB2hmdjATI/AAAAAAAAAmw/rm1VYZbLbNI/s1600/ID-10067289.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DRbiBT1BBjw/UBB2hmdjATI/AAAAAAAAAmw/rm1VYZbLbNI/s320/ID-10067289.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>First, the terms 'cybercrime' and 'digital crime' are often used&nbsp;interchangeably. We can break 'cybercrime' down into '<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cyber">cyber</a>', meaning "computer" or "computer network", and&nbsp;&nbsp;"<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/crime" target="_blank">crime</a>"&nbsp;meaning&nbsp;"an action or an instance of negligence that is deemed injurious to the public welfare or morals or to the interests of the state and that is legally prohibited".<br /><br />Based on these definitions, the definition of '<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cybercrime" target="_blank">cybercrime</a>' can be<span style="background-color: white;">&nbsp;"criminal activity or a crime  that involves the Internet, a computer system, or computer technology".</span><br /><br />This definition makes sense, but when I hear 'cyber', I&nbsp;normally assume a network like, for example, the Internet (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/cyberspace" target="_blank">cyberspace</a>). I am unaware of any term with <a href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Category:English_words_prefixed_with_cyber-" target="_blank">'cyber' as a prefix</a> to describe a stand-alone computer. You could potentially have any cyber-noun, but 'cybercomputer' just doesn't sound quite right; a little redundant, but not completely. Then again, 'cyber' by itself does not (in my mind) conjure up images of a stand-alone computer. To me, 'cyber' implies some sort of connection, communication, and/or information sharing (beyond <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet" target="_blank">sneakernet</a>) And this is how I differentiate between cybercrime and digital crime. I see digital crime as a more general term than cybercrime.<br /><br />To me, if a crime has a&nbsp;primarily&nbsp;digital component, it may be classified as a digital crime. For example, credit card skimmers that have no networking capabilities store all the data to a local disk. To me, this would be a digital crime because the crime is primarily facilitated by a digital device. However, there is no communication with any other device; no 'cyber' component.<br /><br />If we take the same skimmer, and give it some way to connect to a network and upload data, now there is a 'cyber' component. It is still a digital crime, but now because there is a connection and communication, it may also be classified as a cybercrime. A cybercrime, however, must be a digital crime.<br /><br />Now, what are cybercrime technologies?<br /><br />If cybercrime is a criminal activity or a crime that involves the Internet or a transfer of data, then cybercrime technologies are technologies that facilitate the activity, such as the collection and transfer of data that is illegal to collect or transport.<br /><br />When I think of cybercrime technologies, I think of malicious software, platforms and frameworks. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crimeware" target="_blank">Crimeware</a> like ZeuS&nbsp;and SpyEye come to mind, as does frameworks like <a href="http://www.metasploit.com/" target="_blank">metasploit</a>&nbsp;(even though it is a security kit). Anti-forensic could also be included, since they may be used to hide traces of cybercrime.&nbsp;Basically&nbsp;any technology that facilitates the&nbsp;perpetration&nbsp;of cybercrime. Should we then include programs like ssh?<br /><br /><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pubid=xa-50106e2f4b1c5322"><img alt="Bookmark and Share" height="16" src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" style="border: 0;" width="125" /></a><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=xa-50106e2f4b1c5322" type="text/javascript"></script><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Image: <a href="http://www.freedigitalphotos.net/" target="_blank">FreeDigitalPhotos.net</a></span>

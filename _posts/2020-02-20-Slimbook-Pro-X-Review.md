I travel a lot. I also regularly work with large amounts of data. It's difficult to find
a laptop that has enough power to do what you want, but you can also easily take it anywhere.

I've flirted with something like the MS Surface Pro, but I'm a Linux guy at heart. Sometime
around 2013 - with portability and power in mind - I bought a 17" MSI Stealth. It was powerful
and thin, but very wide (of course) and too heavy for everyday travel. Having a slim laptop didn't
really help when the charger is very big.

I carried the MSI to a few countries. Showing demos and giving presentations was great. But
it was too big to do work on during flights. It was a great computer. When the battery no longer
held a charge, it needed to be plugged in all the time. So, it became a desktop PC.

After that, I tried a super-portable MS Surface (not pro). I thought it could charge with a normal
USB connector - no. I thought it could run Linux - no. I was able to write and do some coding on
flights, but demos during training was out of the question. Win10 updates took a very long time,
and I was never sure if I would be able to use the system when I needed to (DoS by update during
two trainings).

Eventually, I got ahold of a 2010ish Macbook Air.

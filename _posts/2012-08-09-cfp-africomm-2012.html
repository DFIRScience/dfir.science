However, designing, developing, and deploying infrastructures and solutions that are affordable and efficient when only limited resources are available is a very challenging task. This presents a setback for developing countries against reaping the benefits that ICTs offers. AFRICOMM 2012 aims to bring together researchers, practitioners, and policy makers in ICT to discuss issues and trends, recent research, innovation advances and on-the-field experiences related to e-Infrastructure, e-Governance, e-Business, and enabling policy and regulations with a deep focus on developing countries.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1">AFRICOMM invites submission of unpublished and quality research papers with novel contributions. All submitted contributions will undergo a double-blind peer review. Accepted papers will be presented at the conference and published by Springer's LNICST series.&nbsp;</div><div class="p1">AFRICOMM 2012, the fourth conference of the series, includes workshops, tutorials, demos and a student track. Research papers may have conceptual as well as practical focus.

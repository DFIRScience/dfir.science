# Call for Papers #
  The 10th International Workshop on Digital Forensics (WSDF 2017)
  [https://www.ares-conference.eu/conference/workshops/wsdf-2017/](https://www.ares-conference.eu/conference/workshops/wsdf-2017/)

  August 29 - September 2, 2017
  Reggio Calabria, Italy


Digital forensics is a rapidly evolving field primarily focused on the extraction, preservation and analysis of digital evidence obtained from electronic devices in a manner that is legally acceptable. Research into new methodologies tools and techniques within this domain is necessitated by an ever-increasing dependency on tightly interconnected, complex and pervasive computer systems and networks. The ubiquitous nature of our digital lifestyle presents many avenues for the potential misuse of electronic devices in crimes that directly involve, or are facilitated by, these technologies. The aim of digital forensics is to produce outputs that can help investigators ascertain the overall state of a system. This includes any events that have occurred within the system and entities that have interacted with that system. Due care has to be taken in the identification, collection, archiving, maintenance, handling and analysis of digital evidence in order to prevent damage to data integrity. Such issues combined with the constant evolution of technology provide a large scope of digital forensic research.

WSDF aims to bring together experts from academia, industry, government and law enforcement who are interested in advancing the state of the art in digital forensics by exchanging their knowledge, results, ideas and experiences. The aim of the workshop is to provide a relaxed atmosphere that promotes discussion and free exchange of ideas while providing a sound academic backing. The focus of this workshop is not only restricted to digital forensics in the investigation of crime. It also addresses security applications such as automated log analysis, forensic aspects of fraud prevention and investigation, policy and governance.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Digital Evidence Extraction and Analysis
* Network Forensics
* Anti-Forensics Techniques
* Physical Memory Acquisition and Analysis
* Digital Forensic Information Visualisation
* Fraud Investigations Involving Technology
* Portable Devices
* Cyber Terrorism and Warfare
* Log Analysis
* Incident Response and Management
* Investigative Case Studies
* Malware Analysis
* Novel Data Recovery Techniques
* Cyber Criminal Profiling
* Big Data in Digital Forensics
* Cyber Crime investigation
* Triage
* Cloud Forensics
* Mobile Forensics
* Investigative Methodologies and Procedures
* Internet of Things (IoT) Forensics
* Emerging challenges in Digital Forensics
* eDiscovery

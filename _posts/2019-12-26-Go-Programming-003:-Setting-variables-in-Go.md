Get started programming in Go! Go (also known as Golang) is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. It is a fast, fun, and powerful programming language.

In this video, we talk about how to create and use a variable in Go. We modify our 'Hello World' program to set and print variables instead of strings. A variable is a core programming concept. A variable is a type of container that can hold data. You can replace the data inside the variable over time.

This series is for anyone that is just getting started in programming. Especially those that want to get into Golang, but don't know where to begin.

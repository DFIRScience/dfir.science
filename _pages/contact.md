I appreciate your interest in DFIRScience. This site started in 2008 (initially as CybercrimeTech) to document open-source software for digital forensic investigations. Since then, we have evolved into creating [tutorials](https://youtube.com/dfirscience) to answer questions from practicing digital forensic investigators.

[Email us](https://us5.list-manage.com/contact-form?u=3664f5bc2c4350bc7454f233d&form_id=42749486e45c8394701634ff776be7b8){:target="_blank"} and we will answer any questions as soon as possible. We are usually active on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dfirscience).

## Goals

Our main goal is to make computing, information security, and digital forensic investigation knowledge accessible to everyone. Infosec and digital forensic knowledge are especially expensive to access. Regardless of budget, we want every investigator to have access to helpful information and tools.

Our ultimate goal is for the revenue generated from this site to support us working full-time to build low-cost digital forensic laboratories for countries in need. We have worked with countries worldwide to increase their digital investigation capacity and capabilities, usually funded by short-term grants. Most countries, however, need long-term support to use resources to their maximum potential. If you are interested in helping us achieve this goal, please [support us](#support).

## Whoami

This site is mainly the work of [Joshua I. James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jijames/). He is a trainer, lecturer, and consultant for digital investigations. He received his Ph.D. in Computer Science at [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/) focusing on AI in digital investigations. He currently runs DFIR.Science in his free time.

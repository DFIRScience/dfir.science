The Legal Informatics and Forensic Science (LIFS) Institute at Hallym University helped to create the 2017-2018 [Digital Forensic Research Workshop (DFRWS) Forensic Challenge](http://www.dfrws.org/dfrws-forensic-challenge). The challenge was announced at DFRWS US 2017 on August 7th. The Digital Forensic Research Workshop is one of the oldest and most respected conferences related to digital forensics.

The forensic challenge is an Internet of Things (IoT) murder mystery. Contestants will use IoT Smart Home-related data to find the murderer(s) and bring them to justice. IoT investigations pose a number of new challenges for investigators. This challenge will help to focus the community on upcoming investigation problems. Challenge solutions are due **Feb. 21, 2018**. Start yours now!

The LIFS Institute used equipment purchased with the support of the [Korea Institute for the Advancement of Technology](https://www.kiat.or.kr/) (KIAT) grant number N0002260.

<div class="tr_bq">When: 4 Nov. 2013</div>Where: Chantilly, Virginia, U.S.A.<br /><br /><img alt="The Sleuth Kit and Digital Forensics Conference 2013 banner" src="http://www.basistech.com/graphics/government-users-conference/osdf2013-banner.png" /><br /><br /><blockquote>The 4th Annual Open Source Digital Forensics Conference will be held on November 5, 2013 in Chantilly, VA. We'll be sending out updates via e-mail and Twitter at #osdfcon.<br />The conference will be attended by digital forensic investigators and developers. This conference sold out quickly last year, and registration closed early due to fire code occupancy limits. This event is a unique opportunity to make investigators aware of your tools, get feedback from users, meet fellow developers, and help direct the future of open source digital forensics software.</blockquote>Unfortunately, I missed out on the call for papers, but this conference is very interesting and a lot of fun. Highly-recommended!

If you want to get into digital forensics you will need to be able to:

1. Acquire data from a suspect computer or phone in a verifiable, forensically-sound way
2. Process the data using common tools
3. Analyze the data to say what actions the user did

Itâ€™s not only about tools, but more about concepts. To practice I would use:

1. Guymager (Linux Forensic Disk Imager)
2. Autopsy (Forensic Processing)
3. Your brain - the analysis is with the investigator - try to analyze your own data and see if you can reconstruct what you did yesterday.

If you can do those three things and document your process, you will be well-positioned in digital forensics.

The  <a href="http://jfdsl.org/" target="_blank">Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law</a> published its first  issue in the 1st quarter of 2006 and is now calling for papers  in, or related to, the following areas for Volume 11 (2016). This list  is provided as a means to guide authors,&nbsp;however, we are open to accept  other topics that relate to cyber security and forensics.

Submissions have tobe made throughtheJDFSL OJS Submission System at http://ojs.jdfsl.org/.To ensure a blinded review process, the following information should be excluded from thesubmission:Authors Names sectionBiography sectionAcknowledgments section (if it contains information identifying the authors).If an article is accepted, author(s) must provide a version in either Microsoft Word or LaTeX with graphics (figures) in GIF, TIF, or PowerPoint formats. Permissions for reprinted material are the sole responsibility of the author(s) and must be obtained in writing prior to publication.JDFSL Submission Evaluation CriteriaManuscripts submitted are expected to be:new and original,well organized and clearly written,of interest to the academic and research communities,not published previously, andnot under consideration for publication in any other journal or bookNOTE:Articles published in or under consideration for other journals should not be submitted.Significantly enhanced versions of manuscripts previously published may be considered. Authors need to seek permission from the publishers of such previous publications.Papers awaiting presentation or already presented at conferences must be significantly enhanced (ideally, taking advantage of feedback received at the conference) in order to receive consideration. If the paper has been presented previously at a conference or other professional meeting, this fact, the date, and the sponsoring organization should be listed in a footnote on the first page.Funding sources should be acknowledged in the Acknowledgements section.The journal Web site is located at http://www.jdfsl.org. If you have questions, please contact the editor of the JDFSL who may be reached via email at editor@jdfsl.org.Aims ScopeThe mission of JDFSL is to publish original research and comments about digital forensics and its relationship to security and law. Contributions are particularly welcome which analyze the results of interdisciplinary research. Publications will include the results of research and case studies that advance the curriculum, practice and understanding of digital forensics methods and techniques to support efficient and effective investigations.The peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law (JDFSL) focuses on the advancement of the field by publishing the state of the art in both basic and applied research conducted worldwide. We purposefully chose to use the word cyber in our tagline, instead of digital to emphasize the cyber culture surrounding computing, and the word cyber also extends itself beyond the technical domain of computing. The Journal???s main aims are to open up the landscape for innovation and discussion, and to continuously bridge the gap between the science and practice of cyber forensics, security and law. This journal encourages both scientists and practitioners to share their discoveries and experiences.JDFSL is of interest to the following stakeholders: cyber forensic/security scientists, cyber security/forensic practitioners, law enforcement officers, lawyers, any governmental agencies with interest in national and local security, and private sector organizations. The Journal will publish the following types of articles:Research articles: These articles should have a strong contribution to the state of the art in cyber forensics/security science. Research could be either applied or basic. Although we anticipate that most of the research that will be published will primarily be computer science centric, the Journal strongly encourages topics that stem from other disciplines such as psychology, sociology, business, accounting, law, philosophy, linguistics, education, criminal justice, political science, social science, and ethics, to participate in the advancement of cyber forensic science. We have no preference on the type of methodology used in the research, as long as the work is both methodologically and scientifically grounded.Open Peer Commentaries: To ensure that there is constant discussion and deliberations in this field, JDFSL encourages experts in the domain to submit commentaries on the state of the art in the field through open peer commentaries. Commentaries seek to provide a critical and/or alternative perspective on the state of the art in cyber forensics/security. For a commentary to be accepted for publication, it should meet one or more of the following criteria: The contribution should offer significant insight into work that has been published in JDFSL.Novel findings substantially contradict well-established research, theory, and practice.It provides insight into bridging the gap between the science and practice of cyber forensics security.It critiques findings of seminal work, research, or practice in the domain.It offers significant contribution by consolidating findings in research and practice.It improves the multidisciplinary nature of the domain.It reviews and provides insight into both tools and methods used in cyber forensics.Book Reviews: The Journal provides a place for peers to share their opinions and reviews of published books in the field of cyber forensics and security science.

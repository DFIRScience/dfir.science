When: Tuesday, May 28, 2013 10:00 AM - 12:00 PM PDT<br />Speaker: Chris Sanft <br /><a href="https://www4.gotomeeting.com/register/966609135" target="_blank">Registration Form</a><br /><br />Attend this session to learn about the industryâ€™s first automated malware triage and analysis module, Cerberus. This is the first solution of its kind that allows you to detect and triage malicious code without using signatures or running it in a sandbox. The first step towards automated reverse engineering, Cerberus provides threat scores and disassembly analysis to determine both the behavior and intent of suspect binaries. During this demonstration, you will learn how Cerberus works and how to use it to gain immediate actionable intelligence without waiting for days or even weeks for the results of traditional analysis.

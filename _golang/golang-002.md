Get started programming in Go! Go (also known as Golang) is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. It is a fast, fun, and powerful programming language.

In this video, we build our first go program. We talk about our first "Hello World" program, and go through what each part of the source code does. Next, we build the program and run it from the command line. Congratulations! You made your first program in Go!

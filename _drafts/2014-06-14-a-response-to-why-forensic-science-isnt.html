This article is in response to Mark Joseph Stern's article <a href="http://ww2.nationalpost.com/m/wp/blog.html?b=news.nationalpost.com%2F2014%2F06%2F11%2Fwhy-forensic-science-isnt-really-science-and-how-it-could-be-killing-innocent-people" target="_blank">Why forensic science isn't really science and how it could be killing people</a>.<br /><br />What people don't seem to realize is that forensic science, and criminal justice in general, is probabilistic. All forensic science methods - including DNA analysis - should have associated error rates per analyst. The problem is that judges, lawyers and juries don't care. They want someone to give them the answer, and a high probability is good enough. The standards of court determine the standards in the lab. The Daubert standard is theoretically a better standard than Frye before it. At least it asks for error rates for the methods, and a general acceptance of the used methods by the scientific community. Some states still use Frye and some use Daubert. Some use their own standards. That is one problem. Furhter, CSI shows have been shown to unjustly increase a jury's confidence in forensic science, but it has also been shown that a jury now expects more forensic evidence that they were not asking for before. In court various hypotheses are put forward. Presented evidence supports or denies those hypotheses, making them more or less likely. In a probabilistic system, there is a probability that innocent people will be put in prison. Forensic science can be improved - both in method and application, but that wont solve the problem. All of the justice system has to understand what "evidence" is. Many don't, so they don't question potential errors, especially juries... A jury (and judge) should be like auditors. Instead they want to be entertained. Forensic science has drastically improved things, but juries haven't changed. In terms of cognitive bias, it is not so easy to force forensic science to fit a theory (if anyone is looking), but it is easy for juries to be biased since they get to vote based on their feelings. This article could be applied to any part of the justice system, and the arguments would still work. All justice systems are broken. The U.S. is arguably one of the 'least broken'. The way to improve it is to take being a jury member seriously. Study what evidence is, and what it says about the crime. Understand the lawyers arguments, and critically analyze them. If the jury does that, our justice system and all related sciences would be forced to immediately improve.

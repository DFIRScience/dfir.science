In this video, we talk about conditional checks (if statements) in Go. Conditional checks are useful when you want to make a decision based on the state of some variable. We can use variables in if statements to change the parameters of the conditional check. This video covers "if statements" in Golang using various logic checking methods. We build on from video 003 and use variables in our loops.

We often talk about digital forensics in criminal and civil investigations, but a lot of innovation happens in military acquisition and investigations. Join us on August 15th, 2022 as we speak with Andrew Lister from Detego Global about starting a digital forensics career via the military.

We will also be giving away some amazing prizes from Detego!

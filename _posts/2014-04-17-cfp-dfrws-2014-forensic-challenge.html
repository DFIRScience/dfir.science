See the <a href="http://www.dfrws.org/2014/challenge/index.shtml" target="_blank">challenge page</a> for more information: <br /><br />Submission deadline: <b><span style="color: red;">May 30, 2014 </span></b><br /><br /><b>Mobile Malware Analysis </b><br />The overall goal of this challenge is to raise the state of the art in digital forensic practice by providing an open public venue for a best-of-breed competition. We challenge contestants to demonstrate effective methods and to develop <b>open source tools</b> for analyzing mobile malware. The winner will be announced in August at the DFRWS USA 2014 conference in Denver, CO.<br /><br />Some examples of capabilities we would like to see:<br /><br /><ul><li>Extracting metadata and components</li><li>Decompiling mobile malware</li><li>Decoding data associated with mobile malware</li><li>Behavioral scanners running on localhost (rather than web-based services)</li><li>Identifying potentially malicious functions</li></ul><br />Contestants are encouraged to select malware samples that are interesting from a forensic analysis perspective, and that exhibit many of the challenges presented by mobile malware.  <br /><br />Mobile malware samples can be obtained from various sources from various sources for their analysis, including <a href="http://www.malgenomeproject.org/">http://www.malgenomeproject.org</a>, <a href="http://virusshare.com/">virusshare.com</a>, and <a href="http://contagiodump.blogspot.com/">http://contagiodump.blogspot.com</a>. Alternately send mail to mobilemalware+subscribegooglegroups(d0t)com.  <br /><br /><b>Two Types of Competition</b><br />Submissions will be grouped into two categories to encourage both practitioners and researchers/developers to participate.  <br /><br /><b>Practitioners:</b> Forensic analysis of mobile malware using existing best-of-breed methods and supporting tools. These submissions must include the malware samples that were analyzed, and documentation detailing all methods, tools and findings.<br /><br /><b>Researchers/Developers:</b> Creation of new techniques and tools for analyzing mobile malware. <br /><br />When submitting your entry to this challenge, please indicate which category you would prefer. Each team can submit only one entry, either as practitioners or researchers/developers (not both).

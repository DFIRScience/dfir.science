REAPERlive Preview has been released as a proof of concept. The ISO is available for <a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/reaperforensics/REAPERlivePreview.iso?use_mirror=master">download at sorceforge</a>. Currently only images are displayed, but lists of documents, movies, and music are presented for a quick view. In our tests the entire preview process takes approximately 3 - 5 minutes to scan drives of 80 to 150Gb, after which a preview of pictures, movies, documents and music is available. Thumbnails of images are created in the background while manual previewing can take place.<br /><br />Automatic imaging is also included in the USB version. The .img file has not been singleed yet, but you can download the newest source from the sourceforge svn and build the image using the included makeREAPERlivePreview.sh script (must be run from a Debian machine with live-helper installed).<br /><br />More updates and documentation coming soon. Please email me with questions, comments and especially test results.<br /><br /><a href="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/reaperforensics/REAPERlivePreview.iso?use_mirror=master">Download Preview ISO here.</a>

Last Friday was the [Cybersecurity Revolution](https://secrev.dfir.science) conference.
The idea for the conference came from my friend at [Serene-Risc](https://www.serene-risc.ca/en).
The concept was something similar to what I, and I think a lot of other people, have been thinking for a while.

The Cybercrime Revolution conference is a 24-hour, online, streaming conference. The idea
is that multiple research groups give local conferences and stream them online. When they are
finished, the next 'presenter' streams their presentation. By doing this you can create a
virtual conference when the streams are put together.

And it worked! ...mostly.

## The Good
We generated A LOT of interesting academic talks over 24 hours. Most of which are still accessible.
Despite any bad stuff I mention I consider this a win for the community, and totally worth the effort.

## The Bad
Time zones. My friend took care of time zone organization. Even for me adding talk times to the conference
website got confusing. I eventually switched to only UTC. The problem with UTC is that people apparently don't know
their offset... Auto calculating time zones, and having time converters for the presenters and audience is necessary.

Streaming. I think all groups ended up using YouTube. Streaming on YouTube will give you different URLs depending
on how you stream. We asked everyone to give us their stream URL before the conference, but most URLs ended up being
incorrect because YouTube event stream URLs are confusing. This is also my fault for not producing a very clear
guide for everyone.

Website or social media control. Multiple organizers need access to all communication
channels, and they need to be promoted before the event. I ran the main website, which
was hosted on Github so people could push changes. The problem is, I was in bed for part
of the conference. When I woke up, a lot had changed and the website was no longer
a good communication channel. Everything moved to Twitter.

## The Worst
The above is just stuff that we need to think how to do better next time. Not really
a big deal at all. We tried, and we learned.

The biggest problem that I saw with the conference was that there was not much
of an exchange. For our part, we had YouTube chat and Twitter available, but received
no questions. I also didn't really ask questions in other groups talks.

The social aspect was really missing. We didn't build networks or closer working relationships.
We didn't make new friends online. That is something that will be harder to fix for the
next conference, but I think it is possible to do.

Part of the lack of interaction is because many groups were running their own local conference.
Not just an online event, but an actual, physical event. We took the old style conference
and put it online. The next step is to find a way to better use the Internet to
enable interaction. I'd also like to see the presenters use the new medium in more
interesting ways.

We (LIFS@Hallym) recorded our talks in front of a projector. I think we could have
done something more interesting, but I'm not sure what format that would take.

## Conclusions
We are a small research lab, and I don't have the budget to send all of our students
to conferences (if you would like to support a student let me know!). For our students
the experience of presenting to a 'real' audience was great.

Our students also watched how other Universities run their conferences (for free).
They were impressed and motivated by the work that others were doing.

Overall, there is a lot we can do differently next time, but this type of conference
is very useful. Useful in a different way than a physical conference, but useful nonetheless.
We should definitely do it again.

I hope everyone enjoyed the conference, or enjoy the videos online. If you didn't see it

Furthermore, unlike disorder in the physical world, a single<br />person can potentially cause national crisis by launching a cyber terror attack.<br />Cyber crisis can have enormous influence on the whole society. Attacks on national major<br />information communications network as shown in the case of 1.25 Internet crisis(Slammer Worm),<br />and organized cyber terrorism from overseas that can lead to leakage of national secrets and<br />technology, is increasing everyday, and is more likely to occur in the future.<br />However, Korea has yet to establish a systematic national anti-cyberterrorism plan or policies and<br />specific procedures to manage such crises. In case of a cyber crisis, this situation may lead to severe<br />danger and serious damage to national security and national interest.<br />Therefore this bill proposes the establishment of a national comprehensive response system<br />involving the government and the private sector, hence detect cyber terror attacks in advance to<br />prevent national cyber crisis and concentrate national capacity in times of crisis to take prompt<br />action.<br />*Executive Summary<br />A.

Heads of central administrative agencies should immediately carry out investigations when<br />damage occurs due to a cyber terror attack, and should notify the Heads of related administrative<br />agencies and the Director of the NIS in cases of critical damage (Article 13).<br />F. The Director of the NIS can issue the Cyber Crisis Alert in the interest of systematic response to<br />cyber terrorism, and the Heads of responsible organizations should take appropriate measures to<br />minimize or restore damage (Article 15).<br />G. The government may organize and operate Cyber Crisis Response Headquarters consisting of<br />related institutions and professionals for analysis, investigation, immediate response, and damage<br />restoration when a Cyber Crisis Alert higher than Alert state is issued (Article 16).<br />H. The government may carry forward policy measures necessary for cyber crisis management,<br />such as technology development, international cooperation, industry development, and human<br />resource development (Article 19, 20, and 21).<br />I.

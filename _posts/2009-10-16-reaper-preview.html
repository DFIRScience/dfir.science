Throughout the time I have been developing REAPER, many people in more developed countries have expressed a need for a type of forensic preview ability. Maybe they do not need to take an image of every machine. Fair enough, says I.<br /><br />Because of this, I have been developing REAPER Preview. It is a live CD based off of Debian Live that automatically generates a preview of the data on the system. Currently I have gallery view of various photo, movie, document, and music formats. The preview is fairly superficial with speed in mind.<br /><br />Also since REAPER is focused on acquisition the ability to automatically image the local suspect drives is still there.<br /><br />For this version OCFA has been replaced by the PTK front-end to TSK. It is meant to be a very light collect-and-go with some analysis capability.<br /><br />As always the goal of REAPER is to be as quick and easy as possible. While Preview is not 100% automatic yet, it is by far the easiest way to preview and image a suspect's machine to an external hard drive.<br /><br />I will be singleing everything I have for this version to the svn either tomorrow or this weekend. Feel free to email me if you would like more information.

All of the examples for SIMILE Timeplot are in YYYY/MM/DD format. I was wanting to plot data down to the minute/second. Looking around I found that the date format of the data (.txt) file should be ISO8601. I tried, but still had problems parsing the time part. Thanks to <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/vipul/resource/SolarSPOT2/similetimeplot.html">this blog</a> I saw two problems I was having. First, the time format should be: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS. So a [time,data] file would look like [2009-02-12 15:10:00,23.407]<br /><br />Next is with the index.html that loads the plot data. Look for the line<br /><br /><code>timeplot1.loadText(dataURL, " ", eventSource);</code><br /><br />What I did not immediately recognize was that the " " bit is actually a field separator. So for comma separated values that line should be:<br /><br /><code>timeplot1.loadText(dataURL, <strong>","</strong>, eventSource);</code><br /><br />Once done everything worked as expected. SIMILE Timeplot and Timeline are great tools. Hope this saves you some research time.<br /><a href="http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeplot/">http://www.simile-widgets.org/timeplot/</a>

We show how to extract faces from video with the video2faces utility in Tsurugi Linux. The tool is relatively easy to use, but you should consider what type of video you will be extracting faces from. High-resolution video takes a long time to process, and you need to crop to areas of interest or you will get more false positives. See two examples of extracting faces from a target video.

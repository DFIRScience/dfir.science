Thank you for your interest in DFIR.Science. This site started in 2008 (originally as CybercrimeTech) as a place to document opensource software for digital forensic investigations. Since then, we have evolved into creating [tutorials](https://youtube.com/dfirscience) to answer questions from practicing digital forensic investigators.

For general questions, follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/dfirscience).

## Goals

Our main goal is to make computing, information security and digitial forensic investigation knowledge accessabile to everyone. Infosec and digital forensic knowledge is especially expensive to access. We want every investigator, regardless of budget, to have access to good quality information and tools.

Our ultimate goal is for the revenue generated from this site to support us working full time to build low-cost digital forensic laboratories for countries in need. We have worked with countries around the world to increase their digital investigation capacity and capabilities, usually funded by short-term grants. Most countries, however, need long-term support to use resources to their maximum potential. If you are interested in helping us achieve this goal, please [support us](#support).

## Whoami

This site is mainly the work of [Joshua I. James](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jijames/). He is a trainer, professor and consultant for digital investigations. He recieved his PhD in Computer Science at [UCD](http://www.ucd.ie/) with a focus on AI in digital investigations. He currently runs DFIR.Science in his free time. If you would like to support this site full-time, please [support us](#support).

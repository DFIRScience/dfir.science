The other day I was looking around, and found <a href="http://missingkids.com/">MissingKids.com</a>. It is a site dedicated to finding missing and exploited children in the US. They also have a sister site <a href="http://www.icmec.org/">ICMEC</a> that offers the same service for international missing children. I began looking into things like the <a href="http://www.amberalert.gov/">amber alert system</a> that anyone living in the US is probably very familiar with. Since I am now in Europe I wanted to know what the equivalent service is, and assumed there would be an EU-wide database. As of yet I have only been able to find <a href="http://www.interpol.int/Public/Children/Missing/Search/Recent.asp">Interpol's missing children register</a>. Amber alert apparently has an 80% success rate.<br /><br />[Update] In 2010 Ireland started <a href="http://www.ica.ie/Amber-Alert.607.aspx" target="_blank">talking about</a> working on an Amber Alert system. I assume, though, this was swept under the rug with the economic troubles.

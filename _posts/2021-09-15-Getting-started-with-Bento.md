The Bento Digital Forensics toolkit is an easy way to manage forensic tools locally or create a live response toolkit to take on-scene. Bento 2021.9 brings many updates to available tools and their management. Learn to download, install and customize the Bento Digital Forensics toolkit.

In this video we will cover running the Bento Digital Forensics toolkit for the first time, installing digital forensic apps using the built-in app manager, installing third-party digital forensic tools, as well as adding and removing custom SyMenu items to Bento.

Bento Digital Forensics Toolkit is developed by the same group that produces Tsurugi Linux, a digital forensic Linux distribution. If you work on live response in Windows, check out the Bento toolkit.

In this video, we use Bento v2021.8 and install third-party tools Kape, FTK Imager 4.5.0 and MAGNET Forensics RAM Capture (MRC) v1.2.

<pre wrap="">CLOUDFOR 2016: Workshop on Cloud Forensics<br />In conjunction with the 9th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Utility and Cloud Computing (UCC), Tongji University, Shanghai, China.<br />6-9 December 2016<br /><br />Scope and Purpose<br />=================<br />As a consequence of the sharp growth in the Cloud Computing market share, we can expect an increasing trend in illegal activities involving clouds, and the reliance on data stored in the clouds for legal proceedings. This reality poses many challenges related to digital forensic investigations, incident response and eDiscovery, calling for a rethink in traditional practices, methods and tools which have to be adapted to this new context. <br />This workshop aims to bring researchers and practitioners together as a multi-disciplinary forum for discussion and dissemination of ideas towards advancing the field of Cloud Forensics. <br /><br />Topics of interest comprise, but are not limited to:<br />* Digital evidence search and seizure in the cloud<br />* Forensics soundness and the cloud<br />* Cybercrime investigation in the cloud <br />* Incident handling in the cloud<br />* eDiscovery in the cloud<br />* Investigative methodologies for the cloud<br />* Forensics readiness in the cloud<br />* Challenges of cloud forensics<br />* Legal aspect of cloud investigations<br />* Tools and practices in cloud forensics<br />* Case studies related to cloud forensics<br />* Forensics-as-a-Service<br />* Criminal profiling and reconstruction in the cloud<br />* Data provenance in the cloud<br />* Law enforcement and the cloud<br />* Big data implications of cloud forensics<br />* Economics of cloud forensics<br />* Current and future trends in cloud forensics<br />* Grid forensics <br /><br />Important dates<br />===============<br />* Paper submission: 15 August 2016 (extended deadline)<br />* Notification of acceptance: 05 September 2016 <br />* Camera-ready submission:  21 September 2016<br /><br />Workshop chairs<br />===============<br />Virginia N.

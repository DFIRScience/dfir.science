Previously we showed how to access a Linux Logical Volume Manager partition inside a forensic disk image. We were looking for a way to access the LVM partition in Windows, and Arsenal Recon helped us out!

This video is about a (currently unreleased v3.9) of Arsenal Image Mounter that supports Linux partitions in forensic disk images. As well as new support for LVM partitions! Now you can easily mount LVM and EXT4 Linux Logical Volumes as a logical disk in Windows! Best of all, you can access the Linux file system just like a local disk!

Check out how easy it is, and look for the official release of [Arsenal Image Mounter v3.9](https://arsenalrecon.com/downloads/)

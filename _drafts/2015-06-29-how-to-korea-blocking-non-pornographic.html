Korea is an interesting country. Laws are made for everything, and strict rules are made for anything that doesn't have a law, but auditing and follow-up are basically non-existent. Usually operations are pushed quickly and with little planning to ensure that the current head of the department / organization / country can get a quick-win, get a raise and not have to care about the massive headache they've left for their successor. Of course, Korea is not the only country where this is common, but I can say it is much more endemic than in other countries I have lived.<br /><br />As a foreigner in the country, it is especially frustrating for me to see the potential of the country and its people, and how organizations that want to help make the country great, are actually fighting against the country by seeking superficial, short term gains. These gains make the country weaker as a whole.<br /><br /><a href="http://queerty.com/" target="_blank">this site</a><br /><br />LG U+ - presumably with the "family" feature set,&nbsp;you will get <a href="http://cleanweb1.uplus.co.kr/kren/?flag=S&amp;uid=?&amp;pid=0&amp;cid=0&amp;host=www.queerty.com&amp;uri=2f746869732d666c6f772d63686172742d746861742d64657374726f79732d72656c6967696f6e732d636173652d616761696e73742d6761792d6d617272696167652d69732d736f2d656173792d616e792d7a65616c6f742d63616e2d7573652d69742d3230313530353036" target="_blank">this</a><a href="http://cleanweb1.uplus.co.kr/kren/?flag=S&amp;uid=?&amp;pid=0&amp;cid=0&amp;host=www.queerty.com&amp;uri=2f746869732d666c6f772d63686172742d746861742d64657374726f79732d72656c6967696f6e732d636173652d616761696e73742d6761792d6d617272696167652d69732d736f2d656173792d616e792d7a65616c6f742d63616e2d7573652d69742d3230313530353036" target="_blank">&nbsp;error</a>&nbsp;telling you "notice on blocking of illegal / harmful website".<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QZVURBj-CQ0/VZEdQV4jhxI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/DvfR0-yyg8M/s1600/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-06-29%2B18%253A03%253A58.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="206" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-QZVURBj-CQ0/VZEdQV4jhxI/AAAAAAAAA-Y/DvfR0-yyg8M/s320/Screenshot%2Bfrom%2B2015-06-29%2B18%253A03%253A58.png" width="320" /></a></div><br /><br />As as been discussed <a href="http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2014/02/economist-explains-3" target="_blank">before</a>, Korea does like its Internet censorship.

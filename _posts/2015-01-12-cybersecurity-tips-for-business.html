They asked for some bullet points that tech-savvy travelers may be able to follow to protect themselves. I threw together some points that are common crime trends, or that I normally think about when travelling.<br /><br />I am assuming the main concern is some type of hacking or data     theft.&nbsp;I'm assuming some technical     capability in my (general) recommendations below, and skipping some     obvious pointers.<br /><br /><ul><li>Coordinate an OFFLINE authentication system with your         secretary or work, and use this authentication token any time         you are talking about money transfers or bank details. Common         threat now - hackers know when you travel and use the confusion         to defraud the company.</li><li>The company should be running a VPN that works over ports 443         and/or port 80.</li><li>Attempt to understand common cyber threats (and their cause)         in the country - are you vulnerable to local attacks?</li><li>Attempt to use systems that are NOT commonly used in the         destination country. Target systems in Korea: Windows, IE,         Android. Avoid these and your chances of being compromised are         much lower. (Linux Live CD/USB is easy to use)<br />      </li><li>Do you need to bring all of your work data with you? Can you         copy only required documents to the system that you bring with         you (threat minimization)? Wipe out the systems when you come         back home.</li><li>Same as above for phones / mobile devices.<br />      </li><li>For business systems incl. phones, use full drive encryption         and remote wipe capabilities (don't mess with location tracking         services).</li><li>Use a procedure for backing up all your data that always         requires two-factor authentication - no remembered logins (if         'cloud-based').</li><li>Be aware of how locals use credit cards. If they don't trust         using cards in their country/city, you probably shouldn't either.         In countries where point of sale (POS) attacks are trending, use cash.<br />      </li><li>If possible (and trust-worthy) it may be better to use a local         anti-virus while you are in the country.</li><li>Try to avoid accessing sensitive information over the         internet. If not using a VPN, prefer mobile broadband. If all         else fails, at least make sure a local wireless connection is         using encryption.</li><li>Manually set your DNS to a trusted server.<br />      </li></ul>These are some of the things I am     thinking about on business trips abroad.<br /><br />Cyber security abroad is really about common sense, and should not be that much different than cyber security at home. Try not to put sensitive information in risky situations, and if you have to, at least try to protect it (trusted VPNs, etc).<br /><br /><span style="font-size: x-small;">Photo by <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/110751683@N02/" target="_blank">Yuri Samoiliv</a></span>

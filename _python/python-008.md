In this video, we combine previous concepts into one bigger project. We use Python and various libraries to create a web server that hosts a guessing game. The web server will accept a number from a user and test whether the number is within a certain range.

This video is quite a bit more complicated than past videos, but it uses each of the concepts we have already discussed. At the end of the video, you will have a simple "web-based" game.  Download code examples [here](https://github.com/jijames/LearnPythonProgramming).

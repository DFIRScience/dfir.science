Privacy is very important to us, and while some information is collected so we can attempt to improve you experience, we want to you know your privacy options.<br /><br />Cybercrime Technologies (this blog) does not share personal information with third parties nor do we store any information about your visit to this blog other than to analyze and optimize your content and reading experience through the use of cookies. <br /><br /><b>Log Files</b><br />As with most other websites, we collect and use the data contained in log files. The information in the log files include your IP (Internet protocol) address, the browser you used to visit our site (such as Internet Explorer or Firefox), the time you visited our site and which pages you visited throughout our site. <br /><br /><b>Cookies and Web Beacons</b><br />We do use cookies to store information, such as your personal preferences when you visit our site. This could include only showing you a popup once in your visit, or the ability to login to some of our features, such as forums. <br /><br />We also use third party advertisements on cybercrimetech.com to support our site. Some of these advertisers may use technology such as cookies and web beacons when they advertise on our site, which will also send these advertisers (such as Google through the Google AdSense program) information including your IP address, your ISP , the browser you used to visit our site, and in some cases, whether you have Flash installed. This is generally used for geotargeting purposes (showing New York real estate ads to someone in New York, for example) or showing certain ads based on specific sites visited (such as showing cooking ads to someone who frequents cooking sites). <br /><br /><b>DoubleClick DART cookies</b><br />We also may use DART cookies for ad serving through Google’s DoubleClick, which places a cookie on your computer when you are browsing the web and visit a site using DoubleClick advertising (including some Google AdSense advertisements). This cookie is used to serve ads specific to you and your interests (”interest based targeting”). The ads served will be targeted based on your previous browsing history (For example, if you have been viewing sites about visiting Las Vegas, you may see Las Vegas hotel advertisements when viewing a non-related site, such as on a site about hockey). DART uses “non personally identifiable information”. It does NOT track personal information about you, such as your name, email address, physical address, telephone number, social security numbers, bank account numbers or credit card numbers. You can opt-out of this ad serving on all sites using this advertising by visiting http://www.doubleclick.com/privacy/dart_adserving.aspx <br /><br />You can chose to disable or selectively turn off our cookies or third-party cookies in your browser settings, or by managing preferences in programs such as Norton Internet Security. However, this can affect how you are able to interact with our site as well as other websites. This could include the inability to login to services or programs, such as logging into forums or accounts. <br /><br />Deleting cookies does not mean you are permanently opted out of any advertising program. Unless you have settings that disallow cookies, the next time you visit a site running the advertisements, a new cookie will be added. <br /><br />Users may opt out of the use of the DoubleClick cookie for interest-based advertising by visiting Google&nbsp;<a href="http://www.google.com/ads/preferences/" target="_blank">Ads Settings</a>. (Alternatively, you can direct users to opt out of a third-party vendor's use of cookies for interest based advertising by visiting <a href="http://aboutads.info/">aboutads.info</a>.) <br /><br />We are not responsible for republished content from this blog on other blogs or websites without our permission. <br /><br />This privacy policy is subject to change without notice and was last updated on April 7, 2014. If you have any questions feel free to contact use directly <a href="https://DFIR.Science/p/contact_25.html">here</a>.<br /><br />This privacy policy is based on information from JenSense.

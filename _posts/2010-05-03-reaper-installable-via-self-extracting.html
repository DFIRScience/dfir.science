We have been looking into easier, more automatic ways for people to install and use REAPER products. Up to now we have mostly been focused on Linux-based distribution, but thanks to a new product we are tying out, <a href="http://www.towodo.com/products/allimage/">All Image</a>, we should be able to create a simple "installer" for Windows. The hope is that you plug in a USB device, double click the Installer icon, point it to the USB drive - and you have a working REAPER install. More to come!

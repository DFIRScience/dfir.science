what do I need to study in order to become a digital forensic investigator?
* At a minimum you need some basic computing skills, basic understanding how to collect and preserve data, basic knowledge of investigation procedure, and knowing some forensic tools would be helpful.
* Do a quick search for "digital forensic investigator" jobs in your area. They will have a listing for the skills they are looking for. There are different "types" of forensic investigator. I focus on criminal investigations. Some investigator only work for private companies. Some work for law firms and do eDiscovery. -- all the same stills are needed, but they do slightly different things.

Do I need to take computer courses in addition to what I am studying now?
* Learning more about computers is always a good idea. I usually recommend something like the CompTIA A+ certification for computer software and hardware basics. You don't need to get certified (it won't hurt), but you should have a good understanding of the topics it covers. I bet your library has a CompTIA A+ book.
* I also recommend learning Python programming. You don't need to be a programming expert, but it will help a lot.

How can I get hands on practice?
* I started with https://linuxleo.com/  - the book, tools and practice image is free.
* Also, try to get https://tsurugi-linux.org/ running in a virtual machine
Once you have looked at those, email me again and I can give you some data to look at.
Later, I'll show you how to "make" your own suspect data to investigate.

In the course that I am taking its all theoretical this is why its also very difficult to understand.
* Theory is important. I bet they are talking about "Chain of Custody" and "Data Verification", right? Two really important topics. Once you start practical disk imaging, everything will make a lot more sense. Hang in there!

This single is informational for digital forensic investigators and first responders. Be aware of the 'USB Killer'. Very basically, it's a USB device that contains a high-voltage capacitor that charges up from the USB power supply, then releases a large charge directly into the USB data bus potentially destroying the motherboard.<br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://www.usbkill.com/themes/leo_python/img/modules/leoslideshow/USB-killer-header-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="196" src="https://www.usbkill.com/themes/leo_python/img/modules/leoslideshow/USB-killer-header-1.jpg" width="320" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">USB Killer device from USB Kill [<a href="https://www.usbkill.com/">https://www.usbkill.com</a>]</td></tr></tbody></table>The device itself is made for 'penetration testers' to test the physical security of a system. The device shown is from USB Kill, but such a device would be trivial to create using any USB device and a high-voltage capacitor - <a href="http://kukuruku.co/hub/diy/usb-killer" target="_blank">like so</a>.<br /><br />Here are some&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/2ys2a7/usb_killer_diy_how_to_build_a_computer_destroying/" target="_blank">comments on Reddit</a> about whether a suspect would be liable if the police seize one of these and fry the investigation computer / write blocker.<br /><br />This device is not to be confused with the <a href="https://www.hotforsecurity.com/blog/usbkill-how-to-turn-a-usb-stick-into-a-kill-switch-that-can-force-a-computer-to-destroy-what-you-were-doing-11772.html" target="_blank">USB Kill Switch</a>, that checks if devices are added or removed and shuts the system down. The USB Killer focused on physical damage.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I've not seen more information on forensic forums about these type of devices. <a href="https://isc.sans.edu/forums/news/USB+Killer+USB+flash+drive+that+would+burn+half+a+laptop+down/889209/" target="_blank">SANS</a> and <a href="http://www.forensicfocus.com/Forums/viewtopic/p=6584906/" target="_blank">Forensic Focus</a> have some short articles on it. The device looks like a normal USB stick. Be sure to check any USB devices before imaging.  <div class="alignleft">     <script type="text/javascript">        amzn_assoc_ad_type = "banner";  amzn_assoc_marketplace = "amazon";  amzn_assoc_region = "US";  amzn_assoc_placement = "assoc_banner_placement_default";  amzn_assoc_campaigns = "books";  amzn_assoc_banner_type = "category";  amzn_assoc_isresponsive = "true";  amzn_assoc_banner_id = "1WV938XZP3V21MG4E2R2";  amzn_assoc_tracking_id = "cybercrimetec-20";  amzn_assoc_linkid = "e9b25ecabef6bfb5b103481d54d17838";      </script>     <script src="//z-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&Operation=GetScript&ID=OneJS&WS=1"></script>    </div>

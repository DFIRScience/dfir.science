The OCFA team has started a <a href="http://ocfa.wiki.sourceforge.net/">wiki</a>. Maybe I am the only one who is ecstatic about this, but there is a "<a href="http://ocfa.wiki.sourceforge.net/how+to+develop">Walk-through in developing and deploying a module</a>"!<br /><br />Also check out the links at to the left for projects that will/do include OCFA.

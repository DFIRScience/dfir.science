<div>A yubikey (from <a href="https://www.yubico.com/" target="_blank">Yubico</a>) is a piece of hardware (USB/NFC) that supports different types of authentication methods -&nbsp;Yubico OTP, smart card (PIV), FIDO U2F, static passwords and others. If you don't have a yubikey, check out the video below to learn a bit more what it is.</div><div><br /></div><div style="text-align: center;"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="281" mozallowfullscreen="" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/137100978?color=8bbf41&amp;title=0&amp;byline=0&amp;portrait=0" webkitallowfullscreen="" width="500"></iframe></div><div><br />I've seen the yubikey before, and finally decided to really see what it is about. I purchased the Yubikey Neo because I was interested in the Neo's ability to use NFC (can use with mobile devices without USB), and especially because it supports <a href="http://www.cybercrimetech.com/search/label/GPG" target="_blank">GPG</a>, which I am extremely interested in getting more police to use. My yubikey is a version 3, and a week after purchase they released the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/products/yubikey-hardware/yubikey4/" target="_blank">Yubikey 4</a> (without NFC, but with stronger GPG keys). It seems like most processes should be the same.<br /><br />When you get the key, it is configured with a yubikey one time password. As-is you can immediately configure it with any services that support security keys (google, github, dropbox, etc.). However, there is a lot more you can do if you want to configure the security key.<br /><br /></div><div>In the <a href="https://www.yubico.com/support/downloads/" target="_blank">yubico downloads</a>, there are a few applications available. It may not be obvious to everyone (it wasn't to me) what each does, and what you may need. This is very basically what each does as far as I understand it now:</div><div><div><ul><li>Authenticator - generates a time-dependent code when it sees the yubikey</li><li>Neo Manager - change connection mode of Yubikey Neo</li><li>Personalization Tool - allows configuration of many yubikey features (OTP/Static Password)</li><li>PIV Tools - manage certificates (Yubikey Neo / 4)</li></ul></div></div><div>For this post, we are focusing on the Personalization Tool installed on Linux (Ubuntu).</div><div><h3>Installing the Personalization Tool</h3></div><div>The personalization tool allows you to configure authentication modes.<br /><br /><br /></div>

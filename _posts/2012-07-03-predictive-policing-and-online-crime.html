While I've not yet found any publications specific to the method, I am assuming the model deals with predicting crime based on the&nbsp;likelihood&nbsp;reoccurrence&nbsp;in a particular area.<br /><br />I have discussed this type of modeling with officers from <a href="https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ci.html" target="_blank">Chile</a> before, who had been working on something similar before 2008. Crime types&nbsp;and the locations in which these were likely to happen could be accurately predicted, they said. The issue with disruption on crime hot-spots, however, is that the overall amount of crime is actually not reduced, but instead dispersed to other areas. For example, if a model predicts crime is likely to happen in a certain area, and officers begin&nbsp;patrolling&nbsp;the area, the crime is probably not tied specifically to the physical location. Yes, the patrol is a deterrent, and crime is reduced in the area, but what the Chile officers found what that the crime moved to other areas in the city.<br /><br />In the LAPD's case, crime was modeled and measured within a specific area. The article submits that "[c]rimes were down in the area 13 percent following the rollout compared to a slight uptick across the rest of the city where the program wasn't being used". The question is, was the "slight uptick" in other areas in the city a result of naturally increasing crime, or is it the result of displacement of crime from identified hot-spots? Based on Chile's experiences, I am guessing the latter.<br /><br />Predictive policing is an interesting concept that seems to be a natural extension of data mining over crime data. However, I have not yet seen research dealing with predictive policing of online crime. Just like a victim of opportunistic crime is likely to be re-victimized in the physical world, is it also likely that a victim of&nbsp;opportunistic&nbsp;crime online would be more likely to be re-victimized? If so, what methods to 'cyber cops' have to disrupt such crime? And finally, if disruption were possible online, would the crimes just be dispersed instead of reduced?<br /><br /><br /><b>Related:</b><br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.math.ucla.edu/~bertozzi/papers/latimes-crime-2010.pdf" style="background-color: white;" target="_blank">Stopping Crime Before it Starts</a></li></ul><br /><br /><b>Google Scholar Search:</b><br /><br /><ul><li><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=predictive+policing" style="background-color: white;" target="_blank">Predictive Policing</a></li><li><a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=modeling+crime" target="_blank">Modeling Crime</a></li></ul><br /><br />Image: <a href="http://www.freedigitalphotos.net/" target="_blank">FreeDigitalPhotos.net</a>

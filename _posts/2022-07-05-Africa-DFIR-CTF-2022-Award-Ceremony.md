Huge DFIR stream with a lot of Q&A. Check out the chapter times below!

ðŸŽ‰ The Africa DFIR CTF 2022 is finished! It ran from 2022-05-30 to 2022-06-27 - four weeks of digital forensic challenges. We covered Linux computer disk investigation, cryptocurrency investigation, dark web investigation, and a few people finally found the suspect and wrote amazing forensic reports!

In this event, we live stream the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime award ceremony.

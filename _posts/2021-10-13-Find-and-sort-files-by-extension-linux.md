Easily find and sort files by extension in the Linux command line. This quick method does not require saving data to a file to output a sorted list of files grouped by extension.

In this video we use find to list files in a directory/subdirectory, grep with regular expressions to filter the find results, rev to reverse characters, sort to sort the lines alphabetically, and then rev again to make the lines human readable.

This is a quick and easy way to group files by extension. Just find and sort using the Linux command line.

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jijames/brainwave-svm-login" target="_blank">Brainwave Classification for Authentication</a></li>
<ul>
<li>A brainwave monitoring and authentication system for testing future security issues. Developed with BoBv5 Brain hacking team.</li>
</ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hvva/generalActions" target="_blank">General Action Detection</a></li>
<ul>
<li>A small script to attempt to associate created digital artifacts with general user activities in a suspect system. This script collects all keywords for files created/accessed/modified at a particular time range. These keywords can be used to start to understand what actions where happening at the specified time.</li>
</ul>

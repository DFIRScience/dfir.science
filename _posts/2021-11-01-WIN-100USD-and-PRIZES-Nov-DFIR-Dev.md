Welcome everyone to the November DFIR Dev competition!

This month we have prizes sponsored by [DFIRScience](https://dfir.science), [Cyber5W](https://www.cyber5w.com/) and [Stark4N6](https://www.stark4n6.com/).

The goal of the competition is to contribute code to ALEAPP, iLEAPP, or WLEAPP. The most useful, innovative, and practical submissions will win cash and other prizes. Three judges will independently score each submission, and the scores will be averaged and ranked. Read below for submission instructions.

**Note:** This is an independent competition hosted by DFIRScience and is not associated with Alexis (Brigs). Please do not contact him about the competition. Instead, [email DFIRScience](https://us5.list-manage.com/contact-form?u=3664f5bc2c4350bc7454f233d&form_id=42749486e45c8394701634ff776be7b8) with any questions.

# Submissions

Code entries will be submitted via Github pull request. You **must** make the pull request to the DFIRScience repositories here: [ALEAPP](https://github.com/DFIRScience/ALEAPP), [iLEAPP](https://github.com/DFIRScience/iLEAPP), [WLEAPP](https://github.com/DFIRScience/ALEAPP). Submissions to the abrignoni repository will *not* be accepted as competition submissions. *All submitted code will be merged with abrignoni repositories after the competition.*

Instructions on how to clone the DFIRScience repository, make code changes, and submit a pull request will be released soon.

Evaluations will be made on a per-repository basis. All code changes on a repository from one author will be considered a submission. Each person can submit to each repository.

For example, you will submit two separate pull requests if you write a module for both ALEAPP and WLEAPP. They will be evaluated as two separate entries.

Alternatively, if you write two new modules for ALEAPP they will be grouped as one pull request and evaluated as one single submission.

## Testing

To allow the judges to test your modules, you must provide test data. This data should show a [minimum working example](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimal_working_example). Note that your code may be executed on Linux, Mac, or Windows.

## Deliverables

1. A code contribution to ALEAPP, iLEAPP, or WLEAPP submitted as a pull request to the DFIRScience repository.
2. Test data and instructions for a minimum working example included as a link in the pull request.
3. Documentation (blog post, text file, video) about the design and usage of your submission included as a link in the pull request.

# Q&A

* Who can participate in the competition?
  * Anyone except judges and XLEAPP core developers (that wouldn't be fair!)
* Do you have to be in the U.S. to participate?
  * No. Anyone from any country can participate.
* What will you do with the code after the competition?
  * We will submit changes to the original developers for inclusion in the mainline tools.
* How can we receive cash prizes?
  * We will arrange the best payment methods with the winners.

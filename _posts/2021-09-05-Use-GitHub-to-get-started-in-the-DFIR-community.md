Wondering where to start in the digital forensics (DFIR) community? Many projects and resources are hosted on GitHub, which allows you to easily participate. All you need is a GitHub account, and you can be contributing valuable resources even without programming experience.

This video walks you through editing text files directly inside GitHub. Text files often contain lists of community resources or documentation. Keeping this information up-to-date is a precious contribution and doesn't require any programming.

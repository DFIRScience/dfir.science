Get started programming in Go! Go (also known as Golang) is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. It is a fast, fun, and powerful programming language.

In this video, we talk about how to install Go. Our install system is on Linux, but the installation on Windows is very similar. After installation, we use a default "hello world" program to test our installation.

This series is for anyone that is just getting started in programming. Especially those that want to get into Golang, but don't know where to begin.

### Forensic Implications

This series will eventually lead to Golang-related functions that are useful for digital investigations. For example, we will show how to hash data, read raw disks, and much more. Work with us, and stay tuned for advanced forensic featurs in Golang!

Writing a drama is difficult. Getting the digital forensic procedure right is more complicated. A digital forensic scientist reacts to Criminal Minds Season 01 Episode 01. Did they collect digital evidence in a forensically sound way, or would the case be thrown out of court? Check out computer investigations from 2005 and where the reality ends and the drama begins.

Overall, they used manufactured problems with digital devices to create tension in the main narrative. They definitely should have investigated a few leads more and probably sped up the investigation!

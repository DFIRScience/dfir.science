Get started programming in Go! Go (also known as Golang) is an open-source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open-source community. It is a fast, fun, and powerful programming language.

In this video, we talk about how to do repetitive processes (loops) in Go. Looping is useful when you want to do some action many times. We can use variables in loops to slightly change the parameters of the action each time the program loops. This video covers "for loops" in Golang using two loop creation methods. We also introduce the concept of a "comment" to add human-readable text inside your code. We build on from video 003 and use variables in our loops.

This series is for anyone that is just getting started in programming. Especially those that want to get into Golang, but donâ€™t know where to begin.

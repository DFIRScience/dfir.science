Linux is being used in many more consumer devices. Investigators should at least have a basic idea of what Linux is, how it is different than Windows and basic usage (because hackers certainly will). This free course from edX by the <a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/" target="_blank">Linux Foundation</a> will give a good overview of how the Linux operating system functions and its usage.<div><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NiPOoOF6Rmw/VAQrIi8QjSI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/fzflMxF3uGA/s1600/LF_logo_color.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NiPOoOF6Rmw/VAQrIi8QjSI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/fzflMxF3uGA/s1600/LF_logo_color.jpg" height="87" width="320" /></a></div><div><div><a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/LinuxFoundationX/LFS101x/2T2014/info" target="_blank">LFS101x: Introduction to Linux</a></div><div><br /></div><div>I am taking it right now. So far it gives a quick and interesting overview and differences between popular distributions. It looks like it goes into some basic usage from a desktop as well as command-line interface. It probably won't make you an expert, but it looks like a great place to start.</div></div><div><br /></div><div>Once you have gone through this course, if you want to know more about investigations using Linux, I strongly recommend the book and resources at <a href="http://www.linuxleo.com/" target="_blank">Linux LEO</a>.</div>

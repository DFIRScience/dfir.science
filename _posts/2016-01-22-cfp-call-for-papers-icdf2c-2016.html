We invite contributions for completed research papers, research-in-progress papers, industrial talks, panel and tutorial proposals, and round table discussions. Research papers are evaluated through a double-blind, peer-reviewing process and accepted research papers will be published in the Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law (JDFSL).<br /><br />JDFSL is an open access journal with a solid indexing including Thomson Reuters ISI Web of Science. Accepted papers will be indexed in: a) Google Scholar b) DBLP c) ProQuest d) EBSCO Host just to name a few. Articles will be available for readers online at no cost given the open access nature of the journal. To learn more about JDFSL you can visit: http://www.jdfsl.org/.<br /><br /><b>Special Themes</b><br />This year, we have two themes that we intend to embrace. Authors are encouraged to submit papers relating to these themes:<br /><br /><ul><li><b>Usage and implications of machine learning in digital forensics</b></li><li><b>Big data and digital forensics</b></li></ul><br /><br /><b>SCOPE</b><br />The Internet has made it easier to perpetrate crimes by providing criminals an avenue for launching attacks with relative anonymity. The increased complexity of global communication and networking infrastructure and devices makes investigation of cybercrimes difficult. Clues of illegal activities are often buried in large volumes of data that need to be sifted through in order to detect crimes and collect evidence. The field of digital forensics and cybercrime investigation has become very important for law enforcement, national security, and information assurance. Digital forensics and cybercrime investigations are multidisciplinary areas that encompasses law, computer science, finance, telecommunications, data analytics, policing and more. ICDF2C brings together practitioners and researchers from diverse fields providing opportunities for business and intellectual engagement among attendees.

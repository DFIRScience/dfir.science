From&nbsp;<a href="http://dfrws.org/2014eu/cfp.shtml">http://dfrws.org/2014eu/cfp.shtml</a><br /><br />The DFRWS-EU Conference that will be held in Amsterdam on the 7-9 May 2014.<br /><br /><b>Important Dates</b><br />Submission deadline: <b>December 9, 2013</b> (any time zone). This is a firm deadline.<br />Author notification: March 1, 2014<br />Final draft and speaker registration: March 30, 2014<br />Conference dates: May 7-9, 2014<br /><br />The DFRWS is dedicated to the sharing of knowledge and ideas about digital forensics research. Ever since it organized the first open workshop in 2001, the DFRWS continues to bring academics and practitioners together in an informal environment.  The digital forensics community is rapidly growing worldwide. To better serve the needs of the community, the DFRWS is starting a sister conference in Europe. The new conference will continue the DFRWS tradition of publishing high quality research outcomes selected in a thorough peer review process. The proceedings will be published on the DFRWS Website as well as in traditional the DFRWS proceedings format.  DFRWS-EU will act as a focal point for the European digital forensic community allowing practitioners and researchers meet and exchange ideas without the need to pay for a transatlantic flight.

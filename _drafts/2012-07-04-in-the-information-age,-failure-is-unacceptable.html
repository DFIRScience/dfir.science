http://www.siliconrepublic.com/business/item/28081-ulster-bank-problems-may/<br /><br />Recent I.T. Issues at Ulster Bank have left thousands of customers unable to access their funds for going on two weeks. The issues are allegedly from software upgrade issues.<br /><br />The Ulster Bank issue has highlighted two issues for me: <br /><br />First, most people, at least in Ireland and the U.S., use automatic bank transfer to receive their pay. The great depression (and the 2008 'depression') was not so long ago, yet society still trusts banks to a relatively high degree. What's more, in our always on culture, we are expecting access to our funds on demand. Even waiting days for wire transfers or checks to clear takes too long.<br /><br />Then something like Ulster Bank happens, and we realize that there is actually quite a risk in banking, even as it becomes more and more required. I've not heard of any monies lost because of the upgrade, but not having access to one's assets for several weeks could, perhaps obviously, cause many problems.<br /><br />So how then could this risk be reduced? Essentially there are multiple points of failure from the employer to the bank. On the employer side, there is probably little to be done to reduce te risk. <br />

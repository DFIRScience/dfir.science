<b>[Update]:</b>&nbsp;This years ISCR is over - see my&nbsp;<a href="https://DFIR.Science/2012/06/international-symposium-on-cybercrime.html">thoughts</a>.<br /><br />The International Symposium on Cybercrime Response (ISCR) is an annual conference held in Seoul, South Korea, and is organized by the Korean National Police (KNP) <a href="http://www.ctrc.go.kr/" target="_blank">Cyber Terror Response Center</a> (CTRC).<br /><br />ISCR 2012 will be (tentatively) held at the end of June with the theme of "Cyber Threats Challenging National Security".<br /><br />

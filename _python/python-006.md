In this video we introduce basic concepts you'll need to get started such as how to create and work with libraries. Libraries are additional code that you can include in your own scripts to provide additional functionality without writing it yourself. Python has a very large collection of libraries, and many users provide libraries on codeshare websites such as Github.

Each library provides additional functionality that you can call. You can (and should) even write your own libraries of functions for different problems you are working on. This will allow you to reuse functions in different scripts.

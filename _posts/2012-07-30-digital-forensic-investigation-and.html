We have a chapter in an upcoming book,&nbsp;<i><a href="http://www.igi-global.com/book/cybercrime-cloud-forensics/69206" target="_blank">Cybercrime and Cloud Forensics: Applications for Investigation Processes</a></i><br /><br />Our chapter aims to be a high-level introduction into fundamental concepts of both digital forensic investigations and cloud computing for non-experts in one or both areas. Once fundamental concepts are established, we examine cloud computing security-related questions; specifically how past security challenges are inherited or solved by cloud computing models, as well as new security challenges that are unique to cloud environments. Next, an analysis is given of the challenges and opportunities cloud computing brings to digital forensic investigations. Finally, the Integrated Digital Investigation Process model is used as a guide to illustrate considerations and challenges during investigations involving cloud environments. <br /><br /><a class="addthis_button" href="http://www.addthis.com/bookmark.php?v=250&amp;pubid=xa-50106e2f4b1c5322"><img alt="Bookmark and Share" height="16" src="http://s7.addthis.com/static/btn/v2/lg-share-en.gif" style="border: 0;" width="125" /></a><script src="http://s7.addthis.com/js/250/addthis_widget.js#pubid=xa-50106e2f4b1c5322" type="text/javascript"></script>

# Scope
Cyberspace is becoming increasingly central to the basic function of modern society. Cybercrime and cyber warfare have emerged as major threats to the integrity of digital information and to the functioning of cyber-controlled physical systems. Such threats have direct consequences for almost all individuals, businesses and organizations, government institutions, and civic processes.

Digital forensics and cybercrime investigations are multidisciplinary areas that encompass law and law enforcement, computer science and engineering, IT operations, economics and finance, data analytics and criminal justice. ICDF2C brings together researchers and practitioners from all these areas in order to scientifically address the numerous challenges due to the rapid increase in the amount and variety of data under investigation, as well as the growing complexity of both the threats and the targeted systems.
Topics

Major topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Advances in Traditional System Forensic Methods: data recovery and reconstruction, filesystem/RAM/network/cache analysis, log analysis, mobile devices, database forensics, evidence obfuscation/sanitization and counter measures
* Multimedia and Artifact Analysis: audio/video reconstruction, data hiding and steganography, source authentication and forgery detection, theft and piracy detection
* Emerging Approaches to Cyber Forensics : evidence acquisition and analysis from cloud services, IoT devices, and social media; automated evidence processing, big data analytics, machine learning, blockchain analysis; digital-forensics-as-a-service
* Incident Response and Malware Analysis : threat detection, reverse engineering, triage, malware analysis and remediation, botnets, operational recovery
* SCADA Forensics and Critical Infrastructure Protection : reverse engineering and analysis of SCADA protocols, attack vectors, defenses; information warfare and attacks on cyber-physical systems
* Digital Forensic Science : theoretical models, applied models, reference data sets, tool testing, calibration, and validation; new approaches to training and education
* Cyber Crime Law, Psychology and Economics : legal developments, cyber crime investigations — methodology and case studies, criminal psychology and profiling, cyber culture, cyber terrorism, online fraud, cyber crime economics and markets, cryptocurrencies and money laundering

Android forensics can take a long time to process. But if you just need a quick overview of the most common artifacts, check out the Android Logs Events And Protobuf Parser (ALEAPP). We show how to get and install ALEAPP, run an Android forensic analysis in less than a minute, and give an overview of what ALEAPP can show in your investigations. If you need to do Android forensics quickly, start with ALEAPP.

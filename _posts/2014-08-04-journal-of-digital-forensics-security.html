The <a href="http://www.jdfsl.org/" target="_blank">Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law</a>&nbsp;(JDFSL) is now an Open Access Journal. They also have a new website that uses the Open Journal System for submission management. If you have never seen the JDFSL before, now is a great time to check out the <a href="http://www.jdfsl.org/current-issue" target="_blank">current issue</a>&nbsp;as well as all the new features.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://d-forensics.org/2014/media/sponsor-images/JDFSL.png" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img alt="Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law" border="0" src="http://d-forensics.org/2014/media/sponsor-images/JDFSL.png" height="272" title="Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law" width="320" /></a></div><br />This peer-reviewed, multidisciplinary Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law (JDFSL) focuses on the advancement of the field by publishing the state of the art in both basic and applied research conducted worldwide. We purposefully chose to use the word cyber in our tagline, instead of digital to emphasize the cyber culture surrounding computing, and the word cyber also extends itself beyond the technical domain of computing. The Journalâ€™s main aims are to open up the landscape for innovation and discussion, and to continuously bridge the gap between the science and practice of cyber forensics, security and law. This journal encourages both scientists and practitioners to share their discoveries and experiences.  <br /><br /><b>Submissions</b><br />Manuscripts should be submitted in Word, RTF, or PDF format using the <a href="http://www.jdfsl.org/submission.asp" target="_blank">JDFSL OJS Submission System</a>.

Get started programming in Go! Go (also known as Golang) is an open source project developed by a team at Google and many contributors from the open source community. It is a fast, fun, and powerful programming language.

In this video, we talk about how to install Go. Our install system is on Linux, but the installation on Windows is very similar. After installation, we use a default "hello world" program to test our installation.

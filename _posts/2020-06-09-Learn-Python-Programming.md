Programming is a useful skill for digital investigators. Not only does programming let you automate your investigation process, but it also helps build a better understanding of how computers work.

To help get you started, we have created an [Introduction to Python course](/python). The course starts from the very basics of python programming. After the basics, we develop scripts to automate digital forensic tasks.

If you have any questions through the course, feel free to comment on Youtube, or tweet at [DFIRScience](https://twitter.com/dfirscience).

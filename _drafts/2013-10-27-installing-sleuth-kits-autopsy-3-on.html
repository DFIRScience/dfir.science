The Sleuth Kit (TSK) is a very nice kit for doing digital investigation tasks. Previously, TSK's tools were cross platform; however, with the newest version (3) of TSK's front-end - Autopsy - the developers decided to make it Windows only. Since most digital investigators around the world are using Windows, I can understand why. However, for investigators that prefer Linux, all is not lost.<br /><br />In this example I will be using Ubuntu.<br />First, install WNE:<br /><blockquote class="tr_bq">apt-get install wine</blockquote>&nbsp;Next, download the Autopsy 3 installer from <a href="http://www.sleuthkit.org/autopsy/download.php" target="_blank">here</a>.<br /><br />With WINE installed, you can simply double-click on the downloaded .msi file. In my case, autopsy-3.0.8-64bit.msi<br />Autopsy setup wizard: Next -&gt; next -&gt; Install<br />When it is finished copying files, click "Finish".<br /><br />Open up the "Configure WINE" tool.<br />Under the applications tab, change the "Windows Version" to "Windows 7"

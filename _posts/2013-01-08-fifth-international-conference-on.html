Fifth International Conference on Digital Forensics and Cyber Crime - ICDF2C 2013<br />25-27 September 2013<br />Moscow, Russia<br /><a href="http://www.d-forensics.org/2013" target="_blank">http://www.d-forensics.org/2013</a><br /><br />Submission deadline: 1st June 2013<br />Notification of Acceptance: 1st August 2013<br />Camera Ready: 1st September 2013<br />Conference Date: 24th and 26th October 2013<br /><br />CALL FOR PAPERS<br />Keeping up with our international theme at ICDF2C, we are proud to announce this year that ICDF2C 2013 will run in parallel to InfoSecurity Russia 2013, the premiere information security industry event in Russia. In addition to maintaining its high academic standards, the 2013 conference participants will be able to attend both the InfoSecurity Russia event and ICDF2C and hear the latest developments in both research and industry. The conference provides a venue which offers chances for networking and high-quality training through expert speakers, state-of-the-art work from researchers all around the world, and tutorials on digital forensic techniques and methods of cyber crime investigation. This ICST conference is endorsed by EAI.<br /><br />[Scope]<br />&nbsp;The Internet has made it easier to perpetrate crimes by providing criminals an avenue for launching attacks with relative anonymity. The increased complexity of the communication and networking infrastructure is making investigation of the cybercrimes difficult. Clues of illegal activities are often buried in large volumes of data that needs to be sifted through in order to detect crimes and collect evidence.   The field of digital forensics and cybercrime investigation has become very important for law enforcement, national security, and information assurance. This is a multidisciplinary area that encompasses law, computer science, finance, telecommunications, data analytics, and policing. This conference brings together practitioners and researchers from diverse fields providing opportunities for business and intellectual engagement among attendees.<br /><br />[Topics]<br />The following topics highlight the conference's theme:<br /><br /><ul><li>Business Applications of Digital Forensics</li><li>Cyber Crime Investigations</li><li>Digital Forensics Techniques and Tools</li><li>Digital Forensics Process &amp; Procedures</li><li>Theoretical Foundations of Digital Forensics</li><li>Digital Forensics &amp; Law</li><li>Mobile / Handheld Device &amp; Multimedia Forensics</li><li>Digital Forensics Standardization &amp; Accreditation</li><li>Cyber Criminal Psychology and Profiling</li><li>Cyber Culture &amp; Cyber Terrorism</li><li>Information Warfare &amp; Critical Infrastructure Protection</li></ul><br />[Submission Cathergories]<br />Submissions can be made in a number of categories:&nbsp;Completed research papers, research-in-progress papers, industrial talks, panel and tutorial proposals, and round table discussions.

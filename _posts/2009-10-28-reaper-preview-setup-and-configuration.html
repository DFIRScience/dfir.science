(Command line instructions)<br />6 Nov. 2010<br /><br />REAPERlive Preview:<br />Extracting a working directory<br />Once you have downloaded the REAPERlivePreview build package<br />http://sourceforge.net/projects/reaperforensics/files/<br /><br />Newest release at this time:<br />http://sourceforge.net/projects/reaperforensics/files/REAPERlivePreview/REAPERPreview_alpha-2_lh_config.tar.gz/download<br /><br />Extract the package<br />tar –xvfz REAPERPreview_alpha-2_lh_config.tar.gz<br /><br />Navigate to the working directory<br />cd REAPERlivePreview<br /><br />Type ls<br />The directory should contain the “makeREAPERlivePreview.sh” script and three directories. This is your working directory.<br /><br />Configuring the image type<br />makeREAPERlivePreview.sh is the build configuration script. You can customize REAPER with any software or architecture supported by Debian live, but the most important setting is at like 39 and 40. Here you can set what type of image you want to create, iso or img (cd or hard drive). Simply put a # in front of the type you do not want, and remove the # from the type you do want.<br />nano makeREAPERlivePreview.sh<br />use the arrow key to scroll down to line 39/40 where<br />#MEDIA=”usb-hdd”<br />MEDIA=”iso”<br />usb-hdd produces a .img file, and iso produces a .iso file. Put the # in front of the file type you do not want, and make sure to remove the # from the file type you do want.<br />hit ctrl+o and enter to save<br />hit ctrl+x to exit<br /><br />Building the REAPER image<br />If there is already a folder named iso or usb-hdd (previous build) delete it<br />rm –r usb-hdd<br /><br />After configuring makeREAPERlivePreview.sh you can build by typing: ./makeREAPERlivePreview.sh<br /><br />*Note: you must have a working internet connection<br /><br />After the script is finished, you wil have a new directory in the working directory titled either “usb-hdd” or “iso” depending on the type of image you specified.<br />Use cd usb-hdd to change to that directory.<br />Another folder for the architecture type will be found (usually i386).<br />cd i386<br /><br />Now do ls and you will see binary.img or binary.iso (depending on what you specified).<br /><br />If it is a .img file you can burn it to a usb stick or hard drive using dd. If it is a iso you must use cd burning software.<br /><br />dd example – make sure you know what you are doing or you might erase your hard drive using dd!!<br /><br />To image a usb stick:<br />First type fdisk –l<br />Note which drive is your usb stick, for example I have /dev/hda and /dev/sda<br />/dev/sda is my usb stick based on the size and partition tables listed<br />Unmount any mounted partitions<br />umount /dev/sda*<br /><br />dd the image file to the stick – this will erase everything on the stick!!<br />dd if=binary.img of=/dev/sda<br /><br />*Note: The created image file is a disk image, not a partition. Do not specify a pre-made partition like /dev/sda1 – it must be the full disk /dev/sda<br /><br />How to set up previewing profiles<br />From the working directory, change to user/REAPER/www/profiles<br />cd user/REAPER/www/profiles<br /><br />Two profiles are already created, autorun and general.<br />autorun always runs automatically<br />general is the template for profiles that can be selected<br /><br />Copy the general template to our new profile ‘exploitation’<br />cp –a general exploitation<br /><br />Move to the new directory<br />cd exploitation<br /><br />Type ls and you will see 3 files.<br />Filetypes: the types of files in a particular category (movie, music, etc.) based on file extension.<br />General.profile: The current profile settings<br />keywords: keywords to search for, each on a new line<br /><br />hashdb: an hfind compatable hash database (md5) can be added with the name hashdb<br /><br />First rename the General.profile to Exploitation.profile. This is where the profile name gets detected.<br />mv General.profile Exploitation.profile<br /><br />From the Exploitation.profile you can change the order or remove entries you are now interested in (the Music section, for example). In this example we will accept the defaults.<br /><br />For exploitation we are interested in pictures and movies, so we will edit the file types.<br />nano filetypes<br /><br />File types must be separated by a | so two entries would look like: \.xls$|\.xlsx$<br />Capitalization does not matter, but the variations do, jpg and jpeg for example.<br />Make the modifications as you see fit.<br /><br />hit ctrl+o and enter to save<br />hit ctrl+x to exit<br /><br />Now edit the keywords file<br />nano keywords<br /><br />add a list of keywords that (semi-generically) correspond to the type of case you are investigating<br /><br />hit ctrl+o and enter to save<br />hit ctrl+x to exit<br /><br />You can also add a hfind md5 hash database, and it must be named hashdb<br /><br />That is it. Now you can build a new live cd, and this profile will be automatically detected.

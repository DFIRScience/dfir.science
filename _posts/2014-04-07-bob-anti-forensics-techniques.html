<br /><div style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><br /></div><br />As a mentor with KITRI's "<a href="http://www.kitribob.kr/" target="_blank">Best of the Best</a>&nbsp;v2.0" information security education program, I was/am a mentor for a digital forensic analysis research group. This group was specifically focusing on anti-forensic action detection, which fits pretty closely with my dissertation work. The first group members produced a brief <a href="https://DFIR.Science/2013/12/bob-indicators-of-anti-forensics.html">survey</a> of anti-forensics encountered in the 'wild' by Korean Law enforcement. The main contents of the survey are in Korean because I forgot to single an English version...<br /><br />From two groups working on the same project, a number of similar tools have been created. I've forked the main modules that can be found under <a href="https://github.com/hvva" target="_blank">IoAF at github</a>. Please feel free to contribute or even fork the projects. We are continuing the project this summer, so hopefully cleaner, consolidated code will be available.<br /><br /><table cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="float: right; margin-left: 1em; text-align: right;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="https://eforensicsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/eForensics_05_2014-1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img alt="eForensics Magazine - Anti Forensics Techniques" border="0" height="320" src="https://eforensicsmag.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/eForensics_05_2014-1.jpg" title="eForensics Magazine - Anti Forensics Techniques" width="221" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">eForensics Magazine: Anti Forensics Techniques</td></tr></tbody></table>While the first IoAF group is working on a paper for Digital Investigation, the second group decided to write an article about <i>A general approach to anti-forensic activity detection</i>. This article gives a pretty good literature review about some of the work done in general anti-forensic detection, then shows the investigators how to determine traces created by anti-forensic programs. The work is somewhat similar to the work of <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=geiger+counter+forensics" target="_blank">Geiger on 'counter forensics'</a>, but - I believe - the proposed method is easier for investigators to implement or even automate.<br /><br />Their article can be found in&nbsp;<a href="https://eforensicsmag.com/anti-forensics-techniques-detection-and-countermeasures-preorder/" target="_blank">eForensics Magazine Vol. 3 No. 5</a>.<br /><div style="margin-left: 24pt; text-indent: -24.0pt;"><br /></div>While the developed tools are currently available on github, the next few months will see them refined. Stay tuned!

Having been in Ireland for a considerable&nbsp;amount&nbsp;of time, I've become well aware of the significance of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamrock" target="_blank">shamrock</a>, and its symbolism beyond&nbsp;commercial associations.<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Oxalis_sp._leaves_-_20020616.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/02/Oxalis_sp._leaves_-_20020616.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>The story, in a nutshell, is that St. Patrick used the shamrock to explain the "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity" target="_blank">Holy Trinity</a>". This is a pretty complicated, abstract concept, but by using the shamrock to signify the three bodies as one, it helped people understand and accept the idea.<br /><br />St. Patrick, in short, had a&nbsp;genius for presentation. His ability to reduce complicated ideas into an easily understood form, that could then in turn be easily explained by new members, helped bring Catholicism to Ireland, and turned a&nbsp;plentiful plant into a symbol of a country's faith.<br /><br />Fast-forward a few&nbsp;centuries where cybercrime is quite a vague term. Concretely defining cybercrime has proven to be difficult, and what attempts were made usually resulted in different definitions and scope from country to country.&nbsp;Understanding&nbsp;cybercrime - and agreeing on the definition - is difficult even for experts in the field who deal with it on a regular basis. If experts have difficulty in&nbsp;accurately communicating about cybercrime to other experts, how then are they able to explain it to non-experts?<br /><br />As the general public become more aware of cybercrime, a lack of universal definition is causing confusion, and fear of some giant, looming, unknowable danger. For example, in <a href="http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-05/10/interpol-cybercrime-centre" target="_blank">this</a> article INTERPOL is focusing on 'fighting cybercrime' with brief references to untouchable organized gangs online, political-oriented attacks, and military organizations. All this, and the fact that "cybercrime is becoming more international", but nowhere is cybercrime actually defined in an easy to understand way.&nbsp;<span style="background-color: white;">Not only is the <i>problem</i> of cybercrime not clear, but what to do about it is also not clear.</span><br /><span style="background-color: white;"><br /></span><span style="background-color: white;">As practitioners dealing with cybercrime, we need to find our 'shamrock'. If a common definition can be established, then we can begin to simplify, explain and educate. The more knowledge people (judges, managers, the public) have, the more they can attempt to protect themselves, and society from a now-identifiable threat.</span><br /><br /><br />Photo:&nbsp;<a href="http://pdphoto.org/">PDPhoto.org</a>
